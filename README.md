### Previous concepts

Basic knowledge in JavaScript conditionals, arrays methods, DOM manipulation, CSS, HTML and of course the desire to learn something cool will make this project more simple for you. ðŸ˜‰

### App roadmap

This is the logic that i implemented in this project, but you always can make it in a different way. 

1. Get the ID and class values of the DOM elements
2. if there is a number button, then take its value 
3. if there is a function button, then make an action
4. put them into a string array
5. eval the expression in the array
6. Display everything in the screen.
